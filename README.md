<h2>🚀 Project Overviews</h2>

<h2>📁 Project 1: Static Website Hosting</h2> Static Website Hosting with S3, Route 53 & CloudFront 
A static website hosted on Amazon S3 with custom domain routing via Route 53 and global content delivery using CloudFront for enhanced performance and low latency.

<h2>🔐 Project 2: IAM Role & Policy Management</h2>
Implementation of access control for AWS resources using IAM roles and custom policies, ensuring secure and principle-of-least-privilege-based access management.

<h2>🚀 Project 5: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions & AWS ECS</h2>
This project demonstrates the automation of a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service). The application code is built, tested, and containerized using Docker, then pushed to Amazon ECR. GitHub Actions automatically triggers the deployment of the updated container to an ECS cluster. This setup enables faster, more reliable, and fully automated deployments of containerized applications directly from your GitHub repository.
